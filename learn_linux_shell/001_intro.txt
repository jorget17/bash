# | What is Linux? |
# +================+

# Linux is a generic term that refers to different open source
# operating systems based on the Linux kernel.

# The Linux kernel was originally created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.

# A kernel is a piece of software that is designed to act as an
# intermediate layer between low-level hardware (processor, memory
# or input/output devices) and high level software (operating system).

# Apart from Linux kernel Linux operating systems rely on GNU
# project utilities (BASH, for example).

# Because of this, Linux is referred to by some as GNU/Linux.

# The GNU project is a collection of free software, a lot of
# which is found in most Linux distributions.

# The Linux kernel is so-called UNIX-like software. This implies
# that is similar to the original Unix kernel, created between 1971
# and 1973 at Bell Labs by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.
# But the Linux kernel is only based on Unix principles and does not
# share code with Unix systems. Famous UNIX systems include the BSDs
# (FreeBSD, OpenBSD) and macOS.

# Linux operating systems can be used as desktop or as server. Most
# Linux usage is accounted for the server landscape. (around 70% of
# all servers on the internet).
# The Linux operating systems fall within distribution families.
# Some of them are Ubuntu (based in Debian), Fedora (based in Red Hat),
# SUSE and Arch.
# Android (with a market share of around 85%) uses a modified version
# of the Linux kernel. The same goes for many SmartTVs, routers,
# modems and other devices.

# | What is BASH? |
# +===============+

# BASH is the most used shell in Linx systems. It is based in sh or
# Bourne Shell. BASH stands for Bourne Again SHell.

# A shell is a user interface. Most often it is used to refer to a
# text-based interface, also called a command-line interface (CLI).
# However, it is called a shell because it can be seen as a shell
# around the kernel; this means that it apllies to CLIs, as well
# to graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

# The purpose of a shell, both CLI and GUI, is to allow the user
# interact with the system: typing in the keyboard will make leters
# appear on the screen, moving the mouse will change the location
# of the cursor on the screen, giving the command to delete a file
# will remove the bytes from the disk...

# In the earliest days of Unix and computers, no GUIs were avaliable
# so all work was performed via CLI. To connect to the shell on a
# running machine a video terminal was used: often this was a very
# simple monitor combined with a keyboard, which was connected with
# a RS-232 serial cable. Commands entered on this video terminal
# were processed by the shell running on the Unix machine. Nowadays
# a piece of software running in a GUI, a terminal emulator, is used
# for interaction with the shell.

# Besides using the Bash shell for direct system interaction, it
# provides another important functionality: the ability to execute
# multiple commands sequentially, with or without user interaction,
# tailored to a specific goal: Bash scripts.
